# Calcium waves in astrocytes coupled to neurons

The goal of the research is to study Ca2+, IP3 waves in astrocytes coupled with neurons.

Model used to describe neurons and astrocytes are from:
1. [Formation of working memory in a spiking neuron network accompanied by astrocytes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01750)
2. [Simple model of spiking neurons](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1257420)
3. [Anti-phase calcium oscillations in astrocytes via inositol (1, 4, 5)-trisphosphate regeneration](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16330095/)
